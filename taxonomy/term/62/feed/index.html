  <description>&lt;span&gt;With Bleak Job Prospects, Parents and Their Children Buy Into Franchises &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the U.S., the economy has been rough since 2008,” said John DeHart, co-founder and chief executive of Nurse Next Door. “You have a lot of seasoned executives getting packages, and they’re looking for new careers. And you have this disproportionately high unemployment in the under-25 group. With that you get the dad/grad trend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2010, after 25 years in the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Uzzi, 55, was laid off from his job as senior vice president for sales at a pharmaceutical company based in Switzerland. He spent a year playing golf and trying to start a consulting career, but he grew bored; going back to the corporate world was not really an option. “Not a lot of attractive job offers came my way,” he said. “None. I was 53. I had been making several hundred thousand dollars a year, and no one wanted to pay me that.” Eight months later, Mr. Uzzi and Ms. Palmer put down $130,000 of Mr. Uzzi’s money to open in Mission Viejo, Calif., a franchise of Nurse Next Door, a home health care service based in Vancouver, British Columbia. With that, they joined a growing number of parent-child partners who have responded to poor job prospects by buying franchises together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
