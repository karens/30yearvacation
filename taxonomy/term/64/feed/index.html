            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an article that discusses something I haven't seen much about, how to manage income taxes in retirement. The strategies are quite different than in your working years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is that possible? The main thing to understand: When it comes to your income, the government doesn’t tax every dollar equally. In fact, some dollars don’t get taxed at all. If you know the rules and are able to structure your income wisely, you could find yourself enjoying a high standard of living in retirement—without paying much tax at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Medicare beneficiaries’ average out-of-pocket health care spending is projected to rise as a share of average per capita Social Security income, from 41 percent in 2013 to 50 percent in 2030&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Fidelity Retirement Income Planner</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Fidelity Retirement Income Planner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Tue, 12/23/2014 - 7:08 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've tried lots of retirement income planners and one that I really like is the Fidelity Investments Retirement Income Planner. This is not a planner for someone who just wants a rough idea of how much money they need to save. This planner is for someone who is serious about figuring out what they'll need and where they stand (although you can bypass the detailed worksheets and get the rough estimate if you prefer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat down with this planner and a printout from my financial program of my most recent annual expenses and filled it out in detail, trying to estimate what my expenses will look like post-retirement. The planner allows you to do things like plug in income from a retirement job, with starting and ending dates. You can also plug in lots of other very specific assumptions, like a future inheiritance or the sale of a house when you plan to downsize. If you take the time to fill these worksheets out it's a great exercise, not just to see if you have saved enough but also to start thinking about what expenses you need to plan for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to be a Fidelity client to use the tool, but there is also a free trial available. Highly recommended!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>30 Years is a Long Time!</title>
  <link>https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/blog-posts/30-years-long-time</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;30 Years is a Long Time!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 11/30/2014 - 11:48 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;Thirty years is a long time!  It’s a lot longer than the span of time between the year my parents had their first glimpse of me and the year I had children of my own. &lt;span&gt; It’s longer than the time between the year I married and the year my oldest child was married. H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ow much my life and needs have changed over that span of time, and how much more they'll change over 30 years!&lt;/span&gt; I'm a homeowner, so in 30 years a I would need:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least one new roof, perhaps two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To replace all the appliances and equipment in the house at least once (think furnace, air conditioner, hot water heater).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To faithfully pay 30 years of real estate taxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To at least minimally update the kitchen or bath, keeping in mind how out-of-date even a twenty year old kitchen or bathroom looks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the price of all these things will increase with inflation, perhaps significantly. Non home-owners would&lt;/span&gt;n’t have some of these expenses, but their rent includes a provision for capital expenses, and that rent would also increase with inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I'll need several automobiles&lt;span&gt;. Even if I keep each car for 10 years, which I try to do, there would be three cars over 30 years. If I traded every two to three years I'd need 10 to 15 cars in 30 years!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And I'll be 30 years older. I'm already seeing the effect of getting older on my health and stamina, there's a lot more of that to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Rethink Your Retirement Income</title>
  <link>https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/news/rethink-your-retirement-income</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Rethink Your Retirement Income&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sat, 11/29/2014 - 7:00 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;WSJ&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many retirees can live well on less than what the financial-planning industry tells them. Here's how to look beyond the formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expensive illnesses, long-term care and extreme longevity can suddenly throw retirees' estimated income needs out of whack. When the Society of Actuaries interviewed middle-class retirees in focus groups earlier this year, "they were managing very carefully, adjusting their spending where they needed to and trying not to draw down" their savings, Ms. Levering says. "But they were not planning for shock events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than planning for higher spending, the actuaries recommend delaying retirement by a few years, or scaling back work gradually, while creating a bigger cushion, the group said in a research report released Dec. 9. But note that many surveys have found retirees who wanted to keep working were pressured to take buyouts or suffered health problems that forced them to retire. An alternative suggested by T. Rowe Price Group in Baltimore is a transitional phase of work for people in their 60s, during which they spend much of the money they would have saved for retirement on travel or other activities they are eager to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property taxes, state and local income taxes, and any taxes on investments play a big part in how much income you'll need in retirement—and they could vary significantly based on geography. "If they move to Florida, they're not going to have any state income tax. If they live in New York with a state pension, the income is tax-free, and for private pensions, the first $20,000 is tax-free," says Beth Blecker, chief executive of Eastern Planning in Pearl River, N.Y. Comparing tax-friendly states for retirees is tricky, since property-tax rates might be low while income taxes are high, or vice versa. Also, some states give retirees breaks on Social Security or pension income, while others don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Rethinking the 4% retirement spending rule</title>
  <link>https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/news/rethinking-4-retirement-spending-rule</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Rethinking the 4% retirement spending rule&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much can you afford to spend in retirement? The answer is getting a little more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

For guidance, many retirees rely on the so-called 4% rule, which says you can withdraw 4% from your savings in the first year of retirement, and then give yourself an annual raise to account for inflation each year, without running a big risk of running out of money. Now, J.P. Morgan is entering the fray with an alternative to the 4% rule of its own. The good news: You’re likely to be able to withdraw more than 4% of your account’s balance each year. The bad news: The method is fairly complicated to implement, so you will need the help of a financial adviser (which is good news for J.P. Morgan, which employs a network of them.)&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Are you saving too much? Here's how to look beyond the formulas.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only hard-and-fast rule for how much retirement income you will need is that there is no hard-and-fast rule. The financial industry's typical rule of thumb—which states that retirees need to save enough to be able to replace 75% to 85% of their preretirement income every year after they stop working—isn't really useful for many people. New research shows that many retirees can live well on less than that but others rack up higher expenses through travel, expensive hobbies or medical costs that can't be avoided. The 75%-to-85% ratio may work for younger workers who have no way of knowing precisely what their incomes or expenses will be as they head into retirement. Enlarge Image Adrian Lubbers But if you're closer to the finish line, it's crucial that you figure out for yourself how much you personally will need in "replacement income"—or the percentage of your working income you'll need in retirement—so you can get a better idea of whether your savings, any pensions and Social Security can provide it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expensive illnesses, long-term care and extreme longevity can suddenly throw retirees' estimated income needs out of whack. When the Society of Actuaries interviewed middle-class retirees in focus groups earlier this year, "they were managing very carefully, adjusting their spending where they needed to and trying not to draw down" their savings, Ms. Levering says. "But they were not planning for shock events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;5 must do's before retirement&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retirement today is not the same as it was for our parent’s generation. The generation today does not want to fade away into woodwork. They want to live a full life after retirement. They want to maintain an active lifestyle and not be dependent on their children. Hence retirement planning takes on a very important role...&lt;/p&gt;

Retirement arrives as a big change in life. You wake up one day and do not have anywhere to go. So the big question is, “Are you ready for it?” What do plan to do after retirement - after seeing all the movies you have saved up, after taking the world trip, after learning to make your breakfast what do you plan to do? For most of us, 60-65 is not old age and we are not quite ready to read the news paper and watch TV all day long. The body and mind are active and you could use your experience for a related work area - a consultancy, teaching, start a business. Besides, keeping the mind supple, it will supplement your retirement income. So if you are nearing your retirement age, it is time to start planning for a post retirement innings.&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;How to tame health care costs when you retire&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us look forward to retirement as a time to shift gears, worry less, and enjoy a slower pace of life. But that rosy picture can quickly change and include some sticker shock as retirement nears, especially when it comes to paying for health care. A couple retiring in 2013 is expected to need $220,000 to cover health care cost in retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple retiring in 2014 is expected to need $220,000 (in today’s dollars) to cover health care costs in retirement, unchanged from last year but still a hefty amount for most retirees.

“Rising health care expenses are forcing people to make educated decisions now more than ever, ranging from the services they utilize to the age they choose to retire,” explains Bradford Kimler, executive vice president of Fidelity Benefits Consulting. “We understand that some people don’t have a choice about when they retire. Sometimes health issues or occupation play a role. So it’s critical that people plan well in advance for the considerable cost of health care by making it part of their overall retirement planning discussions.”&lt;/div&gt;
