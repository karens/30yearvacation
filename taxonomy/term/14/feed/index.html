  <description>&lt;span&gt;Living to 100&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;    &lt;img srcset="https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=i1I1XEUk 325w, https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=QrxmY2mQ 650w, https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=jcUDhpCI 1300w, https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_2600x2600/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=WgA5BCZU 1943w" sizes="(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw" src="https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=i1I1XEUk" alt="100 birthday candles" class="img-responsive" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's realistic to assume I might live to be 100 years old. Or even older. The demographics, and current life expectancies confirm that. If I had retired at age 60, that would have been 40 years of retirement. If I wait to age 70, it's still 30 years of retirement. It's a little mind-boggling to think about living that long, but the possibility is a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just read another article about living to 100, &lt;a href="http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2017/jeanne-calment-plan-to-live-to-100-jj.html"&gt;Live to 100. Plan on It.&lt;/a&gt; It talks about Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122. And she was born in a time when life expectancy was much less than it is now. The article discusses the need to embrace the possibility. As usual, some of the comments on that article miss the point. They say, more or less, "I don't feel like living that long. No thanks." As though you get to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean to live that long? What do I have to do to prepare? I don't necessarily want to live to be 100, but it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My take-away is that I need to do a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I need to take care of my health. Living in poor health to a very old age would not be much fun. At least if I do everything in my power to stay healthy I have a hope of being able to enjoy those years.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I need to take care of my finances. I can't spend everything now and just hope everything works out, I need to assume my money needs to stretch over a very long time. I don't plan to take Social Security until I turn 70, since that will maximize my benefit. And Social Security is one of the few things that promises that it will last as long as I live, no matter how long that is. Whether it can keep that promise is still up for debate, but there is at least a promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>The Effects of Conflicted Investment Advice on Retirement Savings</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;The Effects of Conflicted Investment Advice on Retirement Savings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 06/11/2017 - 10:16 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;Executive Office of the President of the United States&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report examines the evidence on the cost of conflicted investment advice and its effects on Americans’ retirement savings, focusing on IRAs. Investment losses due to conflicted advice result from the incentives conflicted payments generate for financial advisers to steer savers into products or investment strategies that provide larger payments to the adviser but are not necessarily the best choice for the saver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defined contribution plans and IRAs are intricately linked, as the overwhelming majority of money flowing into IRAs comes from rollovers from an employer-based retirement plan, not direct IRA contributions. Collectively, more than 40 million American families have savings of more than $7 trillion in IRAs. More than 75 million families have an employer-based retirement plan, own an IRA, or both. Rollovers to IRAs exceeded $300 billion in 2012 and are expected to increase steadily in the coming years. The decision whether to roll over one’s assets into an IRA can be confusing and the set of financial products that can be held in an IRA is vast, including savings accounts, money market accounts, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, individual stocks and bonds, and annuities. Selecting and managing IRA investments can be a challenging and time-consuming task, frequently one of the most complex financial decisions in a person’s life, and many Americans turn to professional advisers for assistance. However, financial advisers are often compensated through fees and commissions that depend on their clients’ actions. Such fee structures generate acute conflicts of interest: the best recommendation for the saver may not be the best recommendation for the adviser’s bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Fidelity Retirement Income Planner</title>
  <link>https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/links/fidelity-retirement-income-planner</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Fidelity Retirement Income Planner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Tue, 12/23/2014 - 7:08 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've tried lots of retirement income planners and one that I really like is the Fidelity Investments Retirement Income Planner. This is not a planner for someone who just wants a rough idea of how much money they need to save. This planner is for someone who is serious about figuring out what they'll need and where they stand (although you can bypass the detailed worksheets and get the rough estimate if you prefer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat down with this planner and a printout from my financial program of my most recent annual expenses and filled it out in detail, trying to estimate what my expenses will look like post-retirement. The planner allows you to do things like plug in income from a retirement job, with starting and ending dates. You can also plug in lots of other very specific assumptions, like a future inheiritance or the sale of a house when you plan to downsize. If you take the time to fill these worksheets out it's a great exercise, not just to see if you have saved enough but also to start thinking about what expenses you need to plan for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to be a Fidelity client to use the tool, but there is also a free trial available. Highly recommended!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interesting study looks at the impact of family obligations on retirement. The report discusses what it means if you are the "Family Bank". Many retirees will provide financial assistance to parents, children, or grandchildren to pay for their housing, cars, education or healthcare needs, and this is an expense many retirees have failed to factor into their planning. "Gray divorce" impacts retirement as well, after a divorce, household income drops by more than 40% for women and by about 25% for men, and their may be obligations to help step children and grand children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;The 80% Assumption, Maybe Not&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning for retirement is usually over-simplified and full of bad assumptions, like this one: "Assume you will need 70%-80% of what you earned pre-retirement." &lt;span&gt;Well you won't be sending your children through college and maybe you will have your mortgage paid off. And you won't have commuting costs, or still be trying to save for retirement. But on the other hand you will have much higher medical expenses, you may be sending your grandchildren through college, you may be providing financial assistance to your children or your parents. And what are you going to do all day if you're not working? Many of the options cost money, maybe more money than you spent when you were busy working all day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing that's ironic about this is that the estimates are based on your current earnings, not your current current expenses. And some people can, and do, live way below their income, and some live way above it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economist James Poterba of MIT put it all together with colleagues at Dartmouth and Harvard's Kennedy School and estimated that about 46% of Americans die with less than $10,000 in assets, many of them lacking even home equity and relying almost entirely on Social Security. The results can be measured in more than merely dollars and cents. Poterba's paper found that this group is "disproportionately in poor health," in part because they have no resources to cover medical expenses outside Medicare. Most shocking, many of these households were considered to have entered retirement in good financial shape; they didn't count on outliving their plans. For the most part, the consequences of these economic trends have been overlooked in the debate over the future of Social Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
