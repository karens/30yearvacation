            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;AARP&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AARP's 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey talked to people age 50+, divided between those who are already retired and those who are not yet, to try to assess how confident they felt about their retirement. There are lots of interesting findings here, some of them include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Retirees were about equally split between those who retired earlier than they planned and those who retired when they planned. Very few retired later.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Of the 46% of retirees that retired earlier than planned, the primary reason for doing so was health problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Other reasons for retiring earlier than planned included realizing they had saved enough, a job layoff or downsizing, a desire to do something else, and the need to provide caregiving to someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you combine the responses of personal health problems and those that cited a need to care for someone else, you can see that many early retirements were due to someone's health problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple responses were allowed, so there is overlap in these results. Considering health problems and downsizing represent involuntary reasons for retirement, it appears that most of the responses cited involuntary reasons for early retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson to be learned is that you can't wait too long to start planning for retirement, it can happen sooner than you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Retirement Planning In America: Anxiety, Inequality, and the Role of Social Security</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Retirement Planning In America: Anxiety, Inequality, and the Role of Social Security&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 10/30/2016 - 11:44 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While many older Americans look forward to their retirement years with great anticipation, a substantial subset of the aging population is struggling to prepare for retirement and is deeply concerned about the financial realities of this later stage of life, according to a new study conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four in 10 older Americans feel more anxious than excited about retirement. Those with lower household income levels, who sometimes lack the resources to pay their bills on time and/or carry personal debt, are more likely to say that they feel more anxious than those who are in better shape financially. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older Americans with lower incomes are more likely than higher earners to say that they feel more anxious than secure about several specific aspects of retirement, including the size of their retirement savings and their ability to pay for housing and health care expenses in the future. For example, a majority of those with household incomes under $50,000 (58 percent) say they feel more anxious than secure about the amount of savings they have for retirement. But even among those with incomes of $100,000 or more, 40 percent are anxious about the overall savings.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two-thirds of working older Americans are currently saving money for retirement. Those with lower incomes are less likely to say that they are saving money for retirement than other older Americans (47 percent for those earning less than $50,000 vs. 90 percent of those earning $100,000 or more).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Americans age 50 and older report that they have multiple sources of income for retirement, but a substantial minority (44 percent) expect that Social Security will provide the biggest portion of that income. Those who have lower incomes are more likely to plan to rely heavily on Social Security (54 percent for those with incomes of less than $50,000, compared with 25 percent for those with incomes of $100,000 or more) and also tend to report fewer sources overall. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only a third of older Americans who have retirement accounts or other retirement investments have high levels of confidence in how those investments are being managed. Confidence is low across the board no matter if people are managing their investments themselves, relying on a financial advisor, or having family help to manage their investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Fidelity Retirement Income Planner</title>
  <link>https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/links/fidelity-retirement-income-planner</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Fidelity Retirement Income Planner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Tue, 12/23/2014 - 7:08 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've tried lots of retirement income planners and one that I really like is the Fidelity Investments Retirement Income Planner. This is not a planner for someone who just wants a rough idea of how much money they need to save. This planner is for someone who is serious about figuring out what they'll need and where they stand (although you can bypass the detailed worksheets and get the rough estimate if you prefer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat down with this planner and a printout from my financial program of my most recent annual expenses and filled it out in detail, trying to estimate what my expenses will look like post-retirement. The planner allows you to do things like plug in income from a retirement job, with starting and ending dates. You can also plug in lots of other very specific assumptions, like a future inheiritance or the sale of a house when you plan to downsize. If you take the time to fill these worksheets out it's a great exercise, not just to see if you have saved enough but also to start thinking about what expenses you need to plan for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to be a Fidelity client to use the tool, but there is also a free trial available. Highly recommended!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>The other retirement plan: Work past 65</title>

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;Many of Americans assume they’ll find a part-time job or start a consulting firm after they retire. Anthony Webb, the New York-based economist for the Center for Retirement Research notes that there’s a bit of self-delusion at work here.

“The truth is that when people leave their ‘lifestyle jobs’, they end up leaving the workforce pretty quickly,” Webb says. “It’s well documented that all the ‘bridge jobs’, the consulting gigs, the part-time work lasts perhaps a year or two, but not longer.”

Don’t fool yourself. If you’ve worked as an employee all your life, the odds that you’ll suddenly become a successful consultant at the age of 60 or 65 are relatively slim.&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>With longer life spans, retiring at 70 makes sense</title>
  <link>https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/news/longer-life-spans-retiring-70-makes-sense</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;With longer life spans, retiring at 70 makes sense&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 11/03/2013 - 12:00 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even now, financial planners are urging people to work to 70, so they end up with more spending money than if they retire at the full retirement age of 66, or even earlier at 62. At 62, people can get small Social Security benefits, but each year they wait increases their monthly check about 8 percent. According to Munnell's research, retiring at 62, rather than 70, cuts the monthly benefit almost in half. A person who would receive a monthly Social Security check of $1,000 upon retiring at 70 would get $568 at 62. That's been a huge selling point for waiting to retire. In addition, financial planners have emphasized that while investments in 401(k) plans and IRAs can lose money during a bad period in the stock or bond markets, Social Security remains a sure thing — a benefit that consequently must be embraced fully. Not only does it provide a guaranteed payment each month for as long as you live, but it also increases as inflation occurs. So, if you retire now and figure you can live on $3,000 a month, inflation of 3 percent a year will mean you will need about $6,300 for the same lifestyle 25 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Many boomers delay retirement, take on more work&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for other baby boomers, retirement is no longer a magical day on which they will stop working, get a gold watch and live a life of leisure, said Catherine Collinson, president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. More than 60 percent plan to work past age 65 or not retire, she said. “It’s not their parents’ retirement,” Collinson said. “Baby boomers plan and expect to work longer, delay retirement and transition into retirement in a way that involves at least working part time.” The majority of baby boomers, Collinson said, are delaying retirement out of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>The 80% Assumption, Maybe Not</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;The 80% Assumption, Maybe Not&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 07/28/2013 - 8:50 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning for retirement is usually over-simplified and full of bad assumptions, like this one: "Assume you will need 70%-80% of what you earned pre-retirement." &lt;span&gt;Well you won't be sending your children through college and maybe you will have your mortgage paid off. And you won't have commuting costs, or still be trying to save for retirement. But on the other hand you will have much higher medical expenses, you may be sending your grandchildren through college, you may be providing financial assistance to your children or your parents. And what are you going to do all day if you're not working? Many of the options cost money, maybe more money than you spent when you were busy working all day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing that's ironic about this is that the estimates are based on your current earnings, not your current current expenses. And some people can, and do, live way below their income, and some live way above it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economist James Poterba of MIT put it all together with colleagues at Dartmouth and Harvard's Kennedy School and estimated that about 46% of Americans die with less than $10,000 in assets, many of them lacking even home equity and relying almost entirely on Social Security. The results can be measured in more than merely dollars and cents. Poterba's paper found that this group is "disproportionately in poor health," in part because they have no resources to cover medical expenses outside Medicare. Most shocking, many of these households were considered to have entered retirement in good financial shape; they didn't count on outliving their plans. For the most part, the consequences of these economic trends have been overlooked in the debate over the future of Social Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt; Middle-Income Boomers, Financial Security and the New Retirement &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For generations of Americans the right time to retire was usually determined by a number — one’s age. The “right” age to retire was often driven by a company pension formula, and most people assumed they would retire by age 65. Today, more than ever, a new number has emerged in its place — the amount of one’s personal savings. On the new road to retirement, Americans can now retire only when they feel they can afford to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
