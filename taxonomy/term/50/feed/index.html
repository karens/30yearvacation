            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are revisiting what we mean by retirement, and it’s very clear that the definition of what people do even into their 70s is changing a lot, and people are continuing to work full time, continuing to work part time, and that has increased more for women than for men. There has been a big change in family structure, increases in divorce have left women more on their own, they may not be dependent on their husband’s pension or Social Security benefits, and of course women are living longer than men. So they have more need to think ahead to retirement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Rethink Your Retirement Income</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Rethink Your Retirement Income&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sat, 11/29/2014 - 7:00 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;WSJ&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many retirees can live well on less than what the financial-planning industry tells them. Here's how to look beyond the formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expensive illnesses, long-term care and extreme longevity can suddenly throw retirees' estimated income needs out of whack. When the Society of Actuaries interviewed middle-class retirees in focus groups earlier this year, "they were managing very carefully, adjusting their spending where they needed to and trying not to draw down" their savings, Ms. Levering says. "But they were not planning for shock events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than planning for higher spending, the actuaries recommend delaying retirement by a few years, or scaling back work gradually, while creating a bigger cushion, the group said in a research report released Dec. 9. But note that many surveys have found retirees who wanted to keep working were pressured to take buyouts or suffered health problems that forced them to retire. An alternative suggested by T. Rowe Price Group in Baltimore is a transitional phase of work for people in their 60s, during which they spend much of the money they would have saved for retirement on travel or other activities they are eager to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property taxes, state and local income taxes, and any taxes on investments play a big part in how much income you'll need in retirement—and they could vary significantly based on geography. "If they move to Florida, they're not going to have any state income tax. If they live in New York with a state pension, the income is tax-free, and for private pensions, the first $20,000 is tax-free," says Beth Blecker, chief executive of Eastern Planning in Pearl River, N.Y. Comparing tax-friendly states for retirees is tricky, since property-tax rates might be low while income taxes are high, or vice versa. Also, some states give retirees breaks on Social Security or pension income, while others don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Americans seeking softer retirement landing</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Americans seeking softer retirement landing&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;“They say you have the retirement party one day and you come back to work the next,” said Mary Jo Finchum, spokeswoman for the Muscatine, Iowa-based company.

Stanley is among the U.S. employers that have offered workers a softer landing into retirement, allowing them to scale back hours as they prepare to take the plunge and move into part-time positions once it’s official.

“It’s really the best of all worlds,” said John Sayles, a 79-year-old planner at Stanley who cut his hours before formally retiring in 2003, but who has continued to work part time in the decade since. “I’ll probably do it as long as the company would like me to help out.”&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phased retirement programs help companies retain experienced workers and let employees scale back working hours to explore other interests. As baby boomers hit retirement age, many are realizing they're not quite ready to quit work cold turkey. Whether you're worried about the size of your nest egg, leaving unfinished projects at the office or simply filling up the hours of the day, an abrupt shift from corner office to golf course can seem a daunting proposition. SEE ALSO: Try Something New With an Encore Career Such concerns are leading more and more boomers to blur the traditionally sharp boundaries between work and retirement. With help from employers, they're seeking out "phased retirement" arrangements that allow them to scale back their working hours and explore other interests while maintaining workplace benefits and giving their savings more time to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Phased retirement: Employees eager, agencies wary&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 09/15/2013 - 12:00 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;Federal Times&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;Federal employees who are eligible for retirement and meet other requirements could work half-time while getting half of their pension. As they continue to work, phased retirees also will keep accruing additional service credit toward their final pensions.

While on the job, they will have to spend 20 percent of their time in “mentoring activities,” ideally with the employees who will take over for them when they completely retire.

Phased retirement would not be an entitlement; cops, air traffic controllers and other employees subject to mandatory retirement wouldn’t qualify. Even for eligible applicants, agencies would have to approve their requests to go to part-time status, prompting the NTEU to urge creation of an appeal route for those who are turned down.

And while the plan makes clear that phased retirees will be treated as regular employees for purposes of participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, it says nothing about eligibility for dental, vision and long-term care insurance, the union said.&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for other baby boomers, retirement is no longer a magical day on which they will stop working, get a gold watch and live a life of leisure, said Catherine Collinson, president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. More than 60 percent plan to work past age 65 or not retire, she said. “It’s not their parents’ retirement,” Collinson said. “Baby boomers plan and expect to work longer, delay retirement and transition into retirement in a way that involves at least working part time.” The majority of baby boomers, Collinson said, are delaying retirement out of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Federal Register | Phased Retirement</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Federal Register | Phased Retirement&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 07/07/2013 - 6:08 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An effective phased retirement plan has been a long-sought goal. However, under prior law, the problem was that an individual who was retirement eligible but wished to continue employment on a part-time basis generally had little economic incentive to do so because an employee's potential retirement benefits would often be equal to or greater than his or her salary would be for part-time employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person who enters phased retirement (hereafter a “phased retiree,”) would receive more income than he or she would earn by simply changing to a part-time work schedule or by simply retiring, while continuing to share knowledge and expertise with the next generation of Federal leaders via mentoring and role-modeling. Once these individuals fully retire, they will be entitled to a greater annuity than if they had fully retired at the time of transition to phased retirement, but less than if they had continued employment on a full-time basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
