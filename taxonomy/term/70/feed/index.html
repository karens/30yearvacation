            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Is Growing Older. The implications of this demographic shift require attention now. Cities are at the forefront, as their leaders act to help older adults realize healthy, productive, and purposeful lives. Best Cities for Successful Aging examines the capacity of metropolitan areas to address the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities as a new future of successful aging takes shape across America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Home in Retirement&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interesting study by &lt;span&gt;Merrill Lynch and Age Wave examines where retirees choose to live in retirement. Among other interesting results, they found that not only do many retirees choose NOT to downsize their home, they actually move to a larger home to have room for family members to come and visit and as a place that the extended family can gather. That would have a significant impact on planned expenses in retirement that many people probably haven't considered. Retirees also spend a lot of money making home improvements,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; age 55+ households account for nearly half of all spending on home renovations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also identified two distinct phases in this process. In early retirement many people moved to a place chosen for it's climate and activities. In later retirement moves are made for healthcare reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money looked across the country to compile their list and highlighted affordable smaller cities. They paid close attention to things like culture, taxes, activities and healthcare. The list highlights places with populations of 150,000-500,000 people. "When it comes to retirement, you find all those things in major cities, but the cost and congestion makes it really difficult," said Rosato. "So, what we looked for was smaller cities that were affordable - low taxes are very important for people too - but still lots to do." Rosato explained that people aren't looking for the "sleepy, quiet place" their parents chose to retire, but because many retirees now are baby boomers and are looking for an cosmopolitan lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;10 best big cities to retire happily in&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people like big cities, some like small towns. The Milken Institute looks at factors including health-care, affordability, transportation, cultural and outdoor activities, employment and safety, and says these are the 10 best big cities to retire happily in. The best places to spend retirement in are safe and affordable, where people are healthy and generally happy. They’re places with economies that offer job opportunities for those nearing retirement age, and with living arrangements that suit the needs of people ages 65 and older. They’re places that have good transportation systems, and where cultural, recreational and volunteer opportunities enrich the lives of residents. Not everyone wants to retire in a big city, but they have their advantages. The Milken Institute’s list of best cities for successful aging is a thorough analysis that considers 78 factors that most affect the quality of life of those aged 65 and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retirees looking to Nevada can find rugged Western beauty without high West Coast prices. One of Nevada’s biggest draws for many is that it has no state income tax and no inheritance tax, leaving retirees with more money to enjoy. “Low taxes are the underlying driving factor of anybody I talk to that is considering a move to Nevada from California,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
