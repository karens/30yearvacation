  <title>Living to 100</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Living to 100&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;    &lt;img srcset="https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=i1I1XEUk 325w, https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=QrxmY2mQ 650w, https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=jcUDhpCI 1300w, https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_2600x2600/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=WgA5BCZU 1943w" sizes="(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw" src="https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=i1I1XEUk" alt="100 birthday candles" class="img-responsive" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's realistic to assume I might live to be 100 years old. Or even older. The demographics, and current life expectancies confirm that. If I had retired at age 60, that would have been 40 years of retirement. If I wait to age 70, it's still 30 years of retirement. It's a little mind-boggling to think about living that long, but the possibility is a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just read another article about living to 100, &lt;a href="http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2017/jeanne-calment-plan-to-live-to-100-jj.html"&gt;Live to 100. Plan on It.&lt;/a&gt; It talks about Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122. And she was born in a time when life expectancy was much less than it is now. The article discusses the need to embrace the possibility. As usual, some of the comments on that article miss the point. They say, more or less, "I don't feel like living that long. No thanks." As though you get to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean to live that long? What do I have to do to prepare? I don't necessarily want to live to be 100, but it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My take-away is that I need to do a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I need to take care of my health. Living in poor health to a very old age would not be much fun. At least if I do everything in my power to stay healthy I have a hope of being able to enjoy those years.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I need to take care of my finances. I can't spend everything now and just hope everything works out, I need to assume my money needs to stretch over a very long time. I don't plan to take Social Security until I turn 70, since that will maximize my benefit. And Social Security is one of the few things that promises that it will last as long as I live, no matter how long that is. Whether it can keep that promise is still up for debate, but there is at least a promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Rethink Your Retirement Income</title>
  <link>https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/news/rethink-your-retirement-income</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Rethink Your Retirement Income&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sat, 11/29/2014 - 7:00 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;WSJ&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many retirees can live well on less than what the financial-planning industry tells them. Here's how to look beyond the formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expensive illnesses, long-term care and extreme longevity can suddenly throw retirees' estimated income needs out of whack. When the Society of Actuaries interviewed middle-class retirees in focus groups earlier this year, "they were managing very carefully, adjusting their spending where they needed to and trying not to draw down" their savings, Ms. Levering says. "But they were not planning for shock events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than planning for higher spending, the actuaries recommend delaying retirement by a few years, or scaling back work gradually, while creating a bigger cushion, the group said in a research report released Dec. 9. But note that many surveys have found retirees who wanted to keep working were pressured to take buyouts or suffered health problems that forced them to retire. An alternative suggested by T. Rowe Price Group in Baltimore is a transitional phase of work for people in their 60s, during which they spend much of the money they would have saved for retirement on travel or other activities they are eager to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property taxes, state and local income taxes, and any taxes on investments play a big part in how much income you'll need in retirement—and they could vary significantly based on geography. "If they move to Florida, they're not going to have any state income tax. If they live in New York with a state pension, the income is tax-free, and for private pensions, the first $20,000 is tax-free," says Beth Blecker, chief executive of Eastern Planning in Pearl River, N.Y. Comparing tax-friendly states for retirees is tricky, since property-tax rates might be low while income taxes are high, or vice versa. Also, some states give retirees breaks on Social Security or pension income, while others don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economist James Poterba of MIT put it all together with colleagues at Dartmouth and Harvard's Kennedy School and estimated that about 46% of Americans die with less than $10,000 in assets, many of them lacking even home equity and relying almost entirely on Social Security. The results can be measured in more than merely dollars and cents. Poterba's paper found that this group is "disproportionately in poor health," in part because they have no resources to cover medical expenses outside Medicare. Most shocking, many of these households were considered to have entered retirement in good financial shape; they didn't count on outliving their plans. For the most part, the consequences of these economic trends have been overlooked in the debate over the future of Social Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's by far the largest study to look at this, and researchers say the conclusion makes sense. Working tends to keep people physically active, socially connected and mentally challenged - all things known to help prevent mental decline. "For each additional year of work, the risk of getting dementia is reduced by 3.2 per cent," said Carole Dufouil, a scientist at INSERM, the French government's health research agency.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to tame health care costs when you retire</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;How to tame health care costs when you retire&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 07/14/2013 - 9:27 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;Fidelity.com&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us look forward to retirement as a time to shift gears, worry less, and enjoy a slower pace of life. But that rosy picture can quickly change and include some sticker shock as retirement nears, especially when it comes to paying for health care. A couple retiring in 2013 is expected to need $220,000 to cover health care cost in retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple retiring in 2014 is expected to need $220,000 (in today’s dollars) to cover health care costs in retirement, unchanged from last year but still a hefty amount for most retirees.

“Rising health care expenses are forcing people to make educated decisions now more than ever, ranging from the services they utilize to the age they choose to retire,” explains Bradford Kimler, executive vice president of Fidelity Benefits Consulting. “We understand that some people don’t have a choice about when they retire. Sometimes health issues or occupation play a role. So it’s critical that people plan well in advance for the considerable cost of health care by making it part of their overall retirement planning discussions.”&lt;/div&gt;
