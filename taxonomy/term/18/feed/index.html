            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on over 40 years of experience, these are guidelines that a retirement expert uses for his own planning. Some key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work until 70, but not necessarily at the same job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop sources of retirement income.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control living expenses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take care of health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect against catastrophic health conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay socially engaged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Retirement Planning In America: Anxiety, Inequality, and the Role of Social Security</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Retirement Planning In America: Anxiety, Inequality, and the Role of Social Security&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 10/30/2016 - 11:44 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While many older Americans look forward to their retirement years with great anticipation, a substantial subset of the aging population is struggling to prepare for retirement and is deeply concerned about the financial realities of this later stage of life, according to a new study conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four in 10 older Americans feel more anxious than excited about retirement. Those with lower household income levels, who sometimes lack the resources to pay their bills on time and/or carry personal debt, are more likely to say that they feel more anxious than those who are in better shape financially. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older Americans with lower incomes are more likely than higher earners to say that they feel more anxious than secure about several specific aspects of retirement, including the size of their retirement savings and their ability to pay for housing and health care expenses in the future. For example, a majority of those with household incomes under $50,000 (58 percent) say they feel more anxious than secure about the amount of savings they have for retirement. But even among those with incomes of $100,000 or more, 40 percent are anxious about the overall savings.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two-thirds of working older Americans are currently saving money for retirement. Those with lower incomes are less likely to say that they are saving money for retirement than other older Americans (47 percent for those earning less than $50,000 vs. 90 percent of those earning $100,000 or more).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Americans age 50 and older report that they have multiple sources of income for retirement, but a substantial minority (44 percent) expect that Social Security will provide the biggest portion of that income. Those who have lower incomes are more likely to plan to rely heavily on Social Security (54 percent for those with incomes of less than $50,000, compared with 25 percent for those with incomes of $100,000 or more) and also tend to report fewer sources overall. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only a third of older Americans who have retirement accounts or other retirement investments have high levels of confidence in how those investments are being managed. Confidence is low across the board no matter if people are managing their investments themselves, relying on a financial advisor, or having family help to manage their investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>How to Plan for an Unexpected Early Retirement</title>

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people wind up retiring earlier than they planned, due to health or job reasons. Here's how to prepare your finances for that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine this: you’ve been working hard for decades and are starting to feel comfortable with your financial future. All of sudden, a major life event forces you to retire five to 10 years earlier than planned. Now what? Perhaps a serious medical issue emerges. Or you lose your job in your late 50s or early 60s and can’t find another. These and other similar involuntary retirement surprises are not uncommon. In fact, according to the recently released Voya Retire Ready IndexTM, 60 percent of current retirees did not plan to retire when they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems like another life. At the height of his corporate career, Tom Palome was pulling in a salary in the low six-figures and flying first class on business trips to Europe. Today, the 77-year-old former vice president of marketing for Oral-B juggles two part-time jobs: one as a $10-an-hour food demonstrator at Sam’s Club, the other flipping burgers and serving drinks at a golf club grill for slightly more than minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;5 must do's before retirement&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retirement today is not the same as it was for our parent’s generation. The generation today does not want to fade away into woodwork. They want to live a full life after retirement. They want to maintain an active lifestyle and not be dependent on their children. Hence retirement planning takes on a very important role...&lt;/p&gt;

Retirement arrives as a big change in life. You wake up one day and do not have anywhere to go. So the big question is, “Are you ready for it?” What do plan to do after retirement - after seeing all the movies you have saved up, after taking the world trip, after learning to make your breakfast what do you plan to do? For most of us, 60-65 is not old age and we are not quite ready to read the news paper and watch TV all day long. The body and mind are active and you could use your experience for a related work area - a consultancy, teaching, start a business. Besides, keeping the mind supple, it will supplement your retirement income. So if you are nearing your retirement age, it is time to start planning for a post retirement innings.&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Retirement? It's like a career change&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;Stuff&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The label 'retired' no longer reflects the busy, happy people who find fulfillment after work.&lt;/p&gt;

What would you do if you had 30 years left to live after you retired?

Would you hole up at home? Head to the beach - spouse in tow - for golden sands and seas together in your golden years?

Or would you rethink the retirement altogether? Give work a go for another couple of years, better managing your financial burdens and staying occupied?

These questions were hypothetical once upon a time.

But with life expectancy creeping up slowly each year, it's a reality we should all be taking a little more seriously.&lt;/div&gt;
