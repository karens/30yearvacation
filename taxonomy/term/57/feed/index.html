  <description>&lt;span&gt;With Bleak Job Prospects, Parents and Their Children Buy Into Franchises &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the U.S., the economy has been rough since 2008,” said John DeHart, co-founder and chief executive of Nurse Next Door. “You have a lot of seasoned executives getting packages, and they’re looking for new careers. And you have this disproportionately high unemployment in the under-25 group. With that you get the dad/grad trend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2010, after 25 years in the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Uzzi, 55, was laid off from his job as senior vice president for sales at a pharmaceutical company based in Switzerland. He spent a year playing golf and trying to start a consulting career, but he grew bored; going back to the corporate world was not really an option. “Not a lot of attractive job offers came my way,” he said. “None. I was 53. I had been making several hundred thousand dollars a year, and no one wanted to pay me that.” Eight months later, Mr. Uzzi and Ms. Palmer put down $130,000 of Mr. Uzzi’s money to open in Mission Viejo, Calif., a franchise of Nurse Next Door, a home health care service based in Vancouver, British Columbia. With that, they joined a growing number of parent-child partners who have responded to poor job prospects by buying franchises together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Beware!! Creative Solutions to Fund Your New Business&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's sad to see someone get to retirement without enough money to make it through. It's even sadder to see someone save all their life and then lose it needlessly. Many Boomers realize that retirement may be the perfect time to start a new business, maybe that business you've always dreamed of owning. But Boomers have two things that make them attractive targets for schemes that may or may not be in their best interest: they may have a pool of cash that they saved up for retirement and some significant equity in their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been seeing pitches lately that suggest that Boomers who want to start a business or buy a franchise do so using money from their retirement accounts. Ordinarily you may not be able to withdraw the money you need without paying taxes on it, but a new program called Rollover as Business Start-Ups (ROBS) allows you to do it, apparently, without tax consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be very cautious about this. It's not clear that the IRS is going to allow it, and if they rule against it there will be fees and penalties to pay. It's also not clear how it can be unwound later, for instance, to pass the business on to a child. Avoid doing this if you have any other way to finance the business. And even if you don't be sure to get a second, and maybe even a third, opinion from someone who is not trying to sell this program. I was a CPA for many years, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You worked hard to accumlate that money. Don't take any chances with it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you nearing retirement and exploring new opportunities? Or, are you wondering how you will manage once you retire? A growing number of individuals over the age of 50+ are turning to small business ownership. We call them “encore entrepreneurs”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are interested in starting a small business right away or intend to wait until retirement, now is the time to explore the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBA has a number of resources and tools to help encore entrepreneurs effectively prepare for starting and running a small business, including business planning, mentoring and financial assistance. It’s easy to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
