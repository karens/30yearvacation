            <div><p>Many retirees can live well on less than what the financial-planning industry tells them. Here's how to look beyond the formulas.</p><p>Expensive illnesses, long-term care and extreme longevity can suddenly throw retirees' estimated income needs out of whack. When the Society of Actuaries interviewed middle-class retirees in focus groups earlier this year, "they were managing very carefully, adjusting their spending where they needed to and trying not to draw down" their savings, Ms. Levering says. "But they were not planning for shock events."</p><p>Rather than planning for higher spending, the actuaries recommend delaying retirement by a few years, or scaling back work gradually, while creating a bigger cushion, the group said in a research report released Dec. 9. But note that many surveys have found retirees who wanted to keep working were pressured to take buyouts or suffered health problems that forced them to retire. An alternative suggested by T. Rowe Price Group in Baltimore is a transitional phase of work for people in their 60s, during which they spend much of the money they would have saved for retirement on travel or other activities they are eager to start.</p><p>Property taxes, state and local income taxes, and any taxes on investments play a big part in how much income you'll need in retirement—and they could vary significantly based on geography. "If they move to Florida, they're not going to have any state income tax. If they live in New York with a state pension, the income is tax-free, and for private pensions, the first $20,000 is tax-free," says Beth Blecker, chief executive of Eastern Planning in Pearl River, N.Y. Comparing tax-friendly states for retirees is tricky, since property-tax rates might be low while income taxes are high, or vice versa. Also, some states give retirees breaks on Social Security or pension income, while others don't.</p></div>
