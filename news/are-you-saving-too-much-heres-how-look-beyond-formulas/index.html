The financial industry's typical rule of thumb—which states that retirees need to save enough to be able to replace 75% to 85% of their preretirement income every year after they stop working—isn't really useful for many people. New research shows that many retirees can live well on less than that but others rack up higher expenses through travel, expensive hobbies or medical costs that can't be avoided. The 75%-to-85% ratio may work for younger workers who have no way of knowing precisely what their incomes or expenses will be as they head into retirement. Enlarge Image Adrian Lubbers But if you're closer to the finish line, it's crucial that you figure out for yourself how much you personally will need in "replacement income"—or the percentage of your working income you'll need in retirement—so you can get a better idea of whether your savings, any pensions and Social Security can provide it.</p><p>Expensive illnesses, long-term care and extreme longevity can suddenly throw retirees' estimated income needs out of whack. When the Society of Actuaries interviewed middle-class retirees in focus groups earlier this year, "they were managing very carefully, adjusting their spending where they needed to and trying not to draw down" their savings, Ms. Levering says. "But they were not planning for shock events."</p></div>
