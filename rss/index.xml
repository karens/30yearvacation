            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an article that discusses something I haven't seen much about, how to manage income taxes in retirement. The strategies are quite different than in your working years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is that possible? The main thing to understand: When it comes to your income, the government doesn’t tax every dollar equally. In fact, some dollars don’t get taxed at all. If you know the rules and are able to structure your income wisely, you could find yourself enjoying a high standard of living in retirement—without paying much tax at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best articles I've seen explaining how to decide what age to take Social Security. It's not a math problem where you worry about how much you lose if you die young, it's insurance against old age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Sat, 01/27/2018 - 11:24 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/report/medicare-beneficiaries-out-of-pocket-health-care-spending-as-a-share-of-income-now-and-projections-for-the-future/"&gt;new analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has found out-of-pocket health-care costs for Medicare beneficiaries are likely to take up half of their average Social Security income by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many seniors already know, Medicare does not cover an increasing number of expenses related to health care. Among these are supplemental insurance premiums, deductibles, long-term care and dental services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Medicare recipients need to prepare for a big chunk of their income to be consumed by these out-of-pocket costs, according to Kaiser, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that analyzes health-care issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Medicare beneficiaries’ average out-of-pocket health care spending is projected to rise as a share of average per capita Social Security income, from 41 percent in 2013 to 50 percent in 2030&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;Willis Towers Watson&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting study by Willis Towers Watson determined that having an annuity income source was a significant factor in retirement happiness. An annuity income might be provided by an old-fashioned pension, but many employees no longer have access to that kind of pension. The alternative for them would be to use personal savings or funds from a 401k to purchase an annuity from an insurance company. The study found that the presence of some sort of annuity income stream was a particularly significant factor in retirement happiness in households without a lot of retirement investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to some interesting questions about when retirees should buy a private annuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Living to 100</title>
  <link>https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/blog-posts/living-100</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Living to 100&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;    &lt;img srcset="https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=i1I1XEUk 325w, https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=QrxmY2mQ 650w, https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=jcUDhpCI 1300w, https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_2600x2600/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=WgA5BCZU 1943w" sizes="(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw" src="https://30-year-vacation-8.lndo.site/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2017-06/shutterstock_24638308.jpg?itok=i1I1XEUk" alt="100 birthday candles" class="img-responsive" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 06/11/2017 - 3:52 pm&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's realistic to assume I might live to be 100 years old. Or even older. The demographics, and current life expectancies confirm that. If I had retired at age 60, that would have been 40 years of retirement. If I wait to age 70, it's still 30 years of retirement. It's a little mind-boggling to think about living that long, but the possibility is a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just read another article about living to 100, &lt;a href="http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2017/jeanne-calment-plan-to-live-to-100-jj.html"&gt;Live to 100. Plan on It.&lt;/a&gt; It talks about Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122. And she was born in a time when life expectancy was much less than it is now. The article discusses the need to embrace the possibility. As usual, some of the comments on that article miss the point. They say, more or less, "I don't feel like living that long. No thanks." As though you get to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean to live that long? What do I have to do to prepare? I don't necessarily want to live to be 100, but it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My take-away is that I need to do a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I need to take care of my health. Living in poor health to a very old age would not be much fun. At least if I do everything in my power to stay healthy I have a hope of being able to enjoy those years.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I need to take care of my finances. I can't spend everything now and just hope everything works out, I need to assume my money needs to stretch over a very long time. I don't plan to take Social Security until I turn 70, since that will maximize my benefit. And Social Security is one of the few things that promises that it will last as long as I live, no matter how long that is. Whether it can keep that promise is still up for debate, but there is at least a promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>The Effects of Conflicted Investment Advice on Retirement Savings</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;The Effects of Conflicted Investment Advice on Retirement Savings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karen Stevenson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 06/11/2017 - 10:16 am&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;Executive Office of the President of the United States&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report examines the evidence on the cost of conflicted investment advice and its effects on Americans’ retirement savings, focusing on IRAs. Investment losses due to conflicted advice result from the incentives conflicted payments generate for financial advisers to steer savers into products or investment strategies that provide larger payments to the adviser but are not necessarily the best choice for the saver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defined contribution plans and IRAs are intricately linked, as the overwhelming majority of money flowing into IRAs comes from rollovers from an employer-based retirement plan, not direct IRA contributions. Collectively, more than 40 million American families have savings of more than $7 trillion in IRAs. More than 75 million families have an employer-based retirement plan, own an IRA, or both. Rollovers to IRAs exceeded $300 billion in 2012 and are expected to increase steadily in the coming years. The decision whether to roll over one’s assets into an IRA can be confusing and the set of financial products that can be held in an IRA is vast, including savings accounts, money market accounts, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, individual stocks and bonds, and annuities. Selecting and managing IRA investments can be a challenging and time-consuming task, frequently one of the most complex financial decisions in a person’s life, and many Americans turn to professional advisers for assistance. However, financial advisers are often compensated through fees and commissions that depend on their clients’ actions. Such fee structures generate acute conflicts of interest: the best recommendation for the saver may not be the best recommendation for the adviser’s bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-source field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;AARP&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AARP's 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey talked to people age 50+, divided between those who are already retired and those who are not yet, to try to assess how confident they felt about their retirement. There are lots of interesting findings here, some of them include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Retirees were about equally split between those who retired earlier than they planned and those who retired when they planned. Very few retired later.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Of the 46% of retirees that retired earlier than planned, the primary reason for doing so was health problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Other reasons for retiring earlier than planned included realizing they had saved enough, a job layoff or downsizing, a desire to do something else, and the need to provide caregiving to someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you combine the responses of personal health problems and those that cited a need to care for someone else, you can see that many early retirements were due to someone's health problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple responses were allowed, so there is overlap in these results. Considering health problems and downsizing represent involuntary reasons for retirement, it appears that most of the responses cited involuntary reasons for early retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson to be learned is that you can't wait too long to start planning for retirement, it can happen sooner than you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is scary stuff. Medicare is critical if you want to retire. Without it most boomers and seniors would have crippling medical costs in retirement. Privatizing Medicare is NOT a solution. It would save the government money but throw the risk, and increasing costs, back on the recipients. And it's not broke! Don't break it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Obamacare rewrote Medicare … so if you’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you have to address those issues as well. … What people don’t realize is that Medicare is going broke, that Medicare is going to have price controls. … So you have to deal with those issues if you’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Medicare has got some serious problems because of Obamacare. Those things are part of our plan to replace Obamacare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the past four years, I’ve met an increasing number of retirees who have yet to find an enjoyable and productive use of their manifold talents and unbridled energy. Some have been so negatively impacted by retirement that they’re beginning to exhibit signs of depression, and medical issues are beginning to emerge. &lt;span&gt;Given the plethora of needs in the communities where we live, and the talent possessed by retirees, there’s no need for any of us retirees to be bored, nor for needs of the community to go unmet. Imagine for a moment the positive impact a corps of organized and trained volunteers could have on the educational achievement of kids who struggle with reading, math or achieving foreign language competence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
